## Mongo Replica-set
Our 2 tier architecture currently has a serious Single Point of Failure; the database tier.
We currently only run a single instance in a single availability zone. If this were to fail we would not only have down time but we would also have a serious loss of data.
Investigate how to create a replica set using mongo that allows three machines to replicate data and balance the load across three availability zones.

### How it works
To deploy a replica-set, we need to make sure that mongo is installed and mongod service is running. So we made a mongo cookbook that would allowed us to create an AMI with packer to make sure that all DB instances have the two requirements to deploy a replica-set.

If using our mongo cookbook, you need to make sure that in your terraform file, you are using our mongo ami_id, which is **ami-0c388e9d21eea5bd5**.

Once everything is correctly setup, run:  
```
terraform init
```

This is to initialise a working directory containing our Terraform configuration files.

If terraform is initialised correctly, run:
```
terraform plan
```
This is to create an execution plan for you to see if everything in your terraform files meet all the requirements.

If all requirements are met, run:
```
terraform apply
```

When terraform apply is executed successfully, go on AWS, get the public IP address from your Bastion server and ssh into it through your command prompt.

Make sure you have the relevant key imported onto your local environment.

Once you're inside the Bastion, ssh into the Primary DB instance with a private IP address that you can get from AWS instance lists.

Inside, you should be able to ssh into the mongo shell with the following command:
```
mongo
```

With the provision of our mongo cookbook and the image we've created using packer, the replica-set should have already been deployed.

To check if the replica-set exists, run:
```
rs.status()
```

That should then display a list of all the DBs, one should have a status of "Primary", and two should have a status of "Secondary".

If none are displayed, it would mean that the replica-set has not been initialised, you would need to run:
```
rs.initiate({_id: "replSetName", members: [{_id: 0, host: "your db private IP address:27017"}]})
```

Once your Primary DB has successfully been initialised, you can then add the other two DBs to the replica-set as a Secondary member.
```
rs.add({_id: 1, host: "your second db private IP address:27017"}, {_id: 2, host: "your third db private IP address:27017"})
```
Once the two are added to the replica-set successfully, when you run 'rs.status()', you should now be able to see all three members of the set, one Primary and two Secondaries.

#### To deploy the replica-set manually:

This is what our mongo cookbook will automatically do for us. Only do the following if you are setting everything up from scratch.
```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv EA312927
```

This is to ensure the authenticity of software packages by verifying that they are signed with GPG keys, so we first have to import the key for the official MongoDB repository.

```
echo "deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu xenial/mongodb-org/3.2 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.2.list
```

This is to create a list file for MongoDB.
```
sudo apt-get update
```
This is to update the package list.
```
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
```
This will install several packages containing the latest version of MongoDB
```
sudo systemctl start mongod  
```
This is to start the mongod service

To check if your mongod service is running, you can run
```
mongod
```
and it will tell you the status of the service.

Now, you need to reconfigure your mongod.conf file.

To do so, run
```
sudo vi /etc/mongod.conf
```
or
```
sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf
```
Inside the file, you will need to make sure that under 'Net Interface', it should have the following lines:

## Multi AZ Project
Using Terraform and AWS create a load balanced and autoscaled 2 tier architecture for the node example application.
The Architecture should be a "Highly Available" application. Meaning that it has redundancies across all three availabililty zones.
The application should connect to a single database instance.

## ELK STACK
Immutable architectures are notoriously difficult to debug because we no longer have access to the instances and thus do not have access to the logs for those machines.
Log consolidation allows us to have logs files broadcast to a central repository by the instances themselves which allows us to more easily view them.
The ELK stack is a commonly used system for this purpose.
Research the setup of the elk stack and create a cookbook for provisioning the required machines.
